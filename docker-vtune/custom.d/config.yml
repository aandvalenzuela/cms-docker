authentication:
    # Passphrase authentication
    # Access to the server is protected with a passphrase. There are no user names involved - if
    # the passphrase is shared between multiple users then they are treated as the same user.
    # When the server is started for the first time with passphrase authentication then the URL
    # displayed in the stdout will include a one time token that would allow the user to set the
    # passphrase. To reset the passphrase the server needs to be restarted with --reset-passphrase
    # command line option.
#    type: passphrase
    # login session duration (days). Defaults to 365 days
#    sessionDuration: 60

     # Reverse proxy authentication
     type: reverse-proxy
    # http header containing the authorized user ID. Inserted by the reverse proxy
     header: username

    # Anonymous authentication
    # Access to the server is not protected and the server is publicly available to any user. Not
    # recommended for use. If you do run the server with anonymous authentication then at least make
    # sure to run the server without --allow-remote-ui and on a host that other users do not have
    # access to.
    # type: anonymous


    # SAML
    # Users are authenticated with a SAML Identity Provider. It's also advised to enable network
    # user group authorization on SAML Identity Provider side to control access to the server.
#    type: saml
#    rootUrl: https://vtune01.mycompany.com
#    saml:
        # The following fields need to be provided to the SAML Identity Provider administrator.
#        consumePath: '/consume'
#        entityID: 'vtune01.mycompany.com'

        # The following fields are provided by SAML Identity Provider administrator after access is
        # configured.
#        entryPoint: '<IDp administrator provided URL>'
#        cert: '<IDp administrator provided public certificate key>'

         # Additional options
         # SAML auth request binding. Defaults to 'Redirect'
#        authnRequestBinding: 'HTTP-POST'
         # Do not deflate SAML request. Defaults to false.
         # Use this option if the Identity Provider does not support SAML request compression
#        skipRequestCompression: true

# VTune Profiler Server URL
# When enabled, this config is used by the VTune Agent to connect to the server
#serverEndpoint: https://cmssdt.cern.ch/vtune
